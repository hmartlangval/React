If you get MSBuild related error while installing NPM packages like
MSB4132: The tools version "2.0" is unrecognized... that is because of the MS Build version installed, maybe conflict of not present

Depending on the version installed in your system, explictly mention in the npm install command the msvs_version =2012, =2013, =2015 and so on
npm install --save-dev gulp-sass --msvs_version=2017
