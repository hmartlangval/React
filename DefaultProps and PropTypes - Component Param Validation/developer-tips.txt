#Note

1. Webpack configuration "mode" property can be removed, if not found, webpack will treat the build as production
2. If "mode:development" is found, the react library will reference the react.x.x.development.js file and you get development related warnings from console
3. Webpack will pack the react files along with the output script.js file and hence you do not need to import external <script> files from CDN or other sources
4. Usage of "import React from 'react'" becomes meaningful with webpack
5. Usage of "import" will throw error when babel-cli build as the files are externally linked
