1. install React-Router <-- older version
2. better install React-Router-Dom version @4<-- 5 is not exactly same with 4
3. Two types of Router -> HashRouter and BrowserRouter
	HashRouter uses the # in the url as new routes
	BrowserRoute uses the Browser's routing and
4. Good properties:
	Link -> same as <a> in HTML but <Link> will not do a page reload, so good. specially for SPAs
	Route -> components defined in Route are the ones that gets displayed when a url match is found
	Switch -> When multiple routes defined has multiple URL matches, using <Switch> ensures that only the first one is rendered
	useLocation() -> good for getting one property "location" in case we wanted to redirect back to this location
	useParams() -> good to get the URL parameters
	useRouteMatch() -> very good to obtain importantly 2 propertyes "url" and "path" of current Route
	Login is almost same as HOC, but it could be implemented better
	...rest -> this is a declaration meaning that ...rest will store an N number of params passed to it as an Array
